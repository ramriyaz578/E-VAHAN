You select an input element from the DOM using document.querySelector('input') and store it in the inputel variable.

You define an asynchronous function getJSONData that fetches data from a JSON file ('./data.json') and returns it as JSON.

You define an asynchronous function searchrecord that takes a value parameter and performs the following tasks:

Converts the value to uppercase.
Calls the getJSONData function to fetch JSON data.
Searches for a record in the JSON data where the RTOCODE property matches the uppercase value.
If a matching record is found, it updates the content of various HTML elements within the #resultsection element with the details from the JSON record. If no match is found, it hides the #resultsection element.
You add an event listener to the inputel element for the keyup event. When a key is pressed in the input field:

If the pressed key is 'Enter' and the input value has more than 3 characters, it calls the searchrecord function with the input value.
This code essentially listens for user input in an input field and searches for matching records in the JSON data when the user presses 'Enter' with a valid input.
